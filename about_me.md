@def title = "About Me"

# A few things about me

- I am interested in researching new algorithms and writing fast software implementations to accelerate numerical integration for stiff ordinary differential equations and differential-algebraic equations. These equations are an integral part of modeling for mechanical, chemical, and biological systems.

- I like reading fantasy novels during my leisure time.

- I am working on my sleep schedule.
