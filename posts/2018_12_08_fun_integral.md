$$
I = \int_{0}^{2\pi} e^{\cos \theta} \cos(\sin \theta)\; d\theta
$$

is an integral that WolframAlpha cannot YET compute analytically as of today (December 8, 2018). Here is the
[link](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+e%5E(cos(x))*cos(sin(x)),+x+from+0+to+2pi).

I think that there are two ways to tackle this problem by exploiting the
analyticity of the integrand $e^{\cos \theta} \cos(\sin \theta)$. We can
calculate it in the real domain by Taylor series or in the complex domain by
Cauchy's integral formula.

## Solution by Taylor Series

First, let us introduce the function

$$
f(r) = \int_{0}^{2\pi} e^{r \cos \theta} \cos(r \sin \theta)\; d\theta,
$$

so we have the equation $$I = f(1)$$. By Taylor expansion, we have

$$
f(r) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac {f^{(n)}(0)}{n!} r^{n}.
$$

It is easy to show that all the coefficients of this Taylor expansion vanish
except for the first one. Namely, $f(0) = \int_{0}^{2\pi} e^{0 \cos \theta}
\cos(0 \sin \theta)\; d\theta = 2\pi$. The $n$-th derivatives of $f$ at
$0$ must be in the form of

$$
f^{(n)}(0) =
\int_0^{2\pi} \sum_{k{\text{ even }}\wedge\; 0\le k\le n}(-1)^{\frac {k}{2}}{n
\choose k}\cos ^{n-k}\theta \sin ^{k}\theta \; d\theta =
\int_{0}^{2\pi} \cos(n \theta) \; d\theta =
0.
$$

Hence, we have $f(r) = 2\pi = I$.

## Solution by Cauchy's Integral Formula

First, let us introduce the same function

$$
f(r) = \int_{0}^{2\pi} e^{r \cos \theta} \cos(r \sin \theta)\; d\theta.
$$

The integrand can be converted to a complex exponential,

$$
e^{r \cos \theta} \cos(r \sin \theta) = \Re\{e^{r \cos \theta} \cos(r \sin
\theta) + i \sin(r \sin \theta)\} = \Re\{e^{r\cos \theta + ir\sin \theta}\} =
\Re\{e^{re^{i\theta}}\}.
$$

Cauchy's Integral formula at $0$ is

$$
g(0)=\frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{g(z)}{z} \,dz.
$$

If we take $g(z) = e^z$, and $\gamma: re^{i\theta}$, we have

$$
g(0)=\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{g(re^{i\theta})
ire^{i\theta}}{re^{i\theta}} \,d\theta =
\frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} g(re^{i\theta}) \,d\theta.
$$

Note that we have

$$
\Re\{g(re^{i\theta})\} =
\Re\{e^{re^{i\theta}}\} =
e^{r \cos \theta} \cos(r \sin \theta).
$$

Hence,

\begin{align}
g(0) &= e^0 = 1 \\
g(0) &= \frac{1}{2\pi} f(r) \\
f(r) &= 2\pi \\
I &= f(1) = 2\pi.
\end{align}
